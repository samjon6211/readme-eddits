my first program "again"

My name is Carlos, and like many, I suspect I've been interested in learning how to program/code. My ignorance and apprehension of not being computer savy has kept me from learning.  I'm determine, to dominate computer coding/progaming once and for all. 

My changes is related to a brief discription about myself.
